            So far in my 6th week, I have changed my CSS from multiple confusing files, to one main file with embedded CSS for some custom styling. During the past 6 weeks, I have been adding to this file and making <span style="color:rgb(65, 175, 255); font-size:72px;line-height:1em;">&#9989;</span>it as nice as I can possibly make it. So far this is what I have. All of my CSS throughout my site (aside from Halloween page) is using just the main stylesheet in the main directory.

        <p class="textBox indent">
            My Halloween page was revised about 3 times. The first time, I had made a simple layout by modifying my old layout, and since I have been modifying that. It does not go with the central theme on the rest of my site, but I'm okay with that.
        </p>

        <p class="textBox indent">
            Around week 4-5 I started looking up how to do animations and have added misc transitions around my site in places like links and the title. The Halloween page title looks pretty spooky when you hover over it with your mouse or tap on it on mobile.
