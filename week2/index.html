        <p class="indent textBox">So, as you may have figured out, I have moderate knowledge of HTML/CSS.</p>
        <p class="indent textBox">I am not very good with CSS, so most of my content has been static. I definitely want to learn cool CSS animations, and I'm hopig that my teacher will teach them to my class.</p>
        <p class="indent textBox">I like to play around with code and work with Adobe programs in my free time. I know Java very well and have made some little games with it. View my <a class="niceLink" href="http://github.com/ssebs/"> GitHub</a> &nbsp;profile. I also know that the world is moving on to web-based applications and games, which is why I am taking the web development class. If you would like to try these games, <a class="niceLink" href="http://ssebs.github.io">here's</a> a place you could check them out. I made that site with Adobe Muse, which basically eliminates almost all coding in the making of a site. </p>

        <img src="ssebs-logo.png" id="pic" alt="myLogo" />

        <p class="indent textBox">Above is a logo that I made using Illustrator and Photoshop, and I use it in most of the content that I make.</p>

        <p class="indent textBox"><em>About half of this page was googled.</em> Thank you for viewing this page, there is more to come.</p>
