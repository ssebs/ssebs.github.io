        <p>Hello!
I am looking into adopting an older Shiba Inu, and I was hoping you could help me out. 
I've been looking everywhere for rescue Shiba's, but they're so hard to find!
I have a small family of 3 looking to adopt a Shiba, and have had much experience with other dogs before. I have had two toy poodles, and 3 doberman in my close family that I've helped take care of and since the owners of those dogs moved away, I think it's time to get another dog. 
I have my heart set on getting a Shiba Inu because I want an independent dog with the desire to cuddle up with the whole family. I am a 19 year old college student with a stable job in the insurance industry, living with my 20 year old brother and mother in a 3 bedroom home with a small backyard. 

Please let me know if you can help!
Thank you!
Sebastian.</p>
