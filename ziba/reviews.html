            &quot;The Masto is a thick and delicious yogurt which went along very nicely with the lavash bread.&quot;

            &quot;Wow! This place is amazing! The best kabob in town and what's even better is the price. Totally affordable and probably some of the best cumstomer service I have ever seen. I would definately recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great middle eastern food.&quot;

            &quot;Try the salad oliveh, it is like an egg salad with chicken! i was sitting at home one day trying to decide how to make delicious egg salad even more delicious-er. Little did I know, that those entrepreneurial Persians already had the answer... ADD CHICKEN! AWESOME.&quot;

            &quot;Ziba's version is thick and flavorful, and when served over the perfectly fluffy basmati rice, it is to die for.&quot;

            &quot;Solid takeout place for Persian food, which is a bit difficult to find around here. The beef kabob was tender and juicy, while the chicken breasts were fresh and plump. Plenty of rice is provided per plate, as well as a tomato, seasoning, and some tortilla-type bread with butter. The beef kabob entree easily made two meals for me. Items could be more flavorful, but for a quick, healthy bite, this place does it.&quot;

            &quot;I have loved Persian food for a long time and had to try out this location to get my fix on. I got the koobideh kabob and it sure hit the spot. The cheese that comes with the thin bread was noticeably good. The tomato was so good, it was perfectly roasted and certainly complimented the rice and meat-- almost wished I had a second tomato. The beef was good, definitely up there but I can't say it was the best I've ever had. &quot;

            &quot;Long overdue for an update on Ziba...I can't believe my first write up was in 2009. Very happy to report our affair with authentic Persian food continues! Koobideh Kabobs are still our favorite, Ali thanks for keeping up the quality &amp; consistency! Chicken Kabobs good flavor &amp; we LOVE Ziba's rice - its SO fluffy + goes great w/grilled tomatoes! Also, we always order extra Yogurt w/cucumbers and eggplant dip, love the Lavash bread! If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and go try Ziba! &quot;
